# Tour: What Can I Do?

Friendly onboarding when users ask about capabilities.

## Triggers

Activate when user says things like:
- "what can you do?"
- "what can I do?"
- "help me get started"
- "show me around"
- "what features are available?"
- "how does this work?"

## Response Template

Give a warm, practical overview:

## What I Can Do

I'm Claude Code with persistent memory and specialized capabilities. Here's what makes me useful:

### Code & Development
- **Write & edit code** - any language, any framework
- **Debug issues** - trace errors, find root causes
- **Refactor** - improve structure without breaking things
- **Test** - write and run tests, validate changes

### Memory & Context
- **Remember across sessions** - learnings persist to SQLite/PostgreSQL
- **Recall past work** - search what worked/failed before
- **Handoffs** - create snapshots to resume complex work

### Research & Planning
- **Explore codebases** - understand unfamiliar projects fast
- **Plan implementations** - architect before coding
- **Search the web** - find docs, solutions, best practices

### Specialized Agents
I can spawn sub-agents for complex tasks:
- `explorer` - map codebase structure
- `kraken` - implement with TDD workflow
- `debug` - investigate issues systematically

### Quick Tips
- Ask naturally - I'll figure out which tools to use
- Say "create a handoff" before ending sessions
- Say "what worked for X before?" to recall past learnings

**What would you like to work on?**

## Style Notes

- Be welcoming, not overwhelming
- Focus on practical value, not feature lists
- End with an invitation to start working
- Don't list every skill - highlight categories
